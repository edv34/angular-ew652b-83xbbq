Tabs:
"Filter" tab displays combined saved data from the other two tabs.
"Edit" tabs allow adding and removing rows, as well as applying or canceling any changes. Saving shows a loading spinner for some time, simulating a time consuming process. This does not prevent the user from switching to other tabs and interacting with them.

Using the filter:
You can filter the displayed table by 2 fields: ID and Name.

In case of ID, comparison operators are used. Such as ==,<,>,<=,>=.
Example: "id<=10"

For filtering by name you have 2 options:
  Simple string
All the names that contain the string will be displayed.
Example: "name like 'jack'"

  Regular expression
If the string is enclosed with two slashes, it will be considered a regular expression.
Example: "name like '/^.a[sc]+/'"

You can also use "and","or" to combine multiple subqueries.
Example: id<30 and id>10 or name like 'oliver' 

Export/Import
The corresponding buttons allow you to either export the table in its current filtered state as .json, or import values to it from a local .json file.

Save filter
This feature is supposed to upload current filter state to a file specified in appsetting.json, but because of stackblitz limitations, it saves it to a local file.
